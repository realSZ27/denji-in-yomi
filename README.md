# Denji mod for YOMI Hustle
This an updated version of the [original csm mod](https://github.com/GithubSPerez/hustle-chainsaw-man). This is a joint project between me and [yospankdaddy](https://steamcommunity.com/id/gipter08/), who did most of the animation. In it's current state, he only has one attack and the art is pretty shoddy. I would definitely appreciate any [contributions](#Contributions) for the art, since neither of use are very good at it. ~~All the aseprite files are included~~ (not all of them, but I'll get the rest soon).

In it's current state, it's not really a real character. We'll hopefully get some more attacks soon so you can at least try it out against a real person.

# Install
It'll be on the steam workshop soon, but for now, this is the only way to get it.

1. Download the latest [release](https://github.com/realSZ27/denji-in-yomi/releases)
2. Open your YOMI folder and create a new folder named ``mods`` (if it's not there already)
3. Place the zip file inside this folder
4. Done!

# Contributions
If you want to contribute art, just open a pull request and it'll most likely get merged. If you want to fix any balance, please open an issue instead so we can have a meaningful conversation before any work gets done. 

Copyright falls under the licence in this repo; you're free to use it as long as you credit whoever wrote the code/drew the art.
